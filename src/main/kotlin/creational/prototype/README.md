Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

## When to use it
* Use the Prototype pattern when your code shouldnâ€™t depend on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy.
* Use the pattern when you want to reduce the number of subclasses that only differ in the way they initialize their respective objects.

## Pros
* You can clone objects without coupling to their concrete classes.
* You can get rid of repeated initialization code in favor of cloning pre-built prototypes.
* You can produce complex objects more conveniently.
* You get an alternative to inheritance when dealing with configuration presets for complex objects.

## Con
Cloning complex objects that have circular references might be very tricky.
