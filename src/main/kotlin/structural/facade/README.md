Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

## When to use it
* Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.
* Use the Facade when you want to structure a subsystem into layers.

## Pros
* You can isolate your code from the complexity of a subsystem.

## Con
* A facade can become a god object coupled to all classes of an app.
