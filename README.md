# Design Patterns Exploration

This repository is dedicated to studying and implementing various design patterns, which are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. 
The goal of this project is to understand the principles behind these patterns and learn how to apply them effectively in real-world scenarios.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
Design patterns provide a standardized approach to solving recurring design problems. They are categorized into three main types:

1. Creational Patterns - Focus on object creation mechanisms.
1. Structural Patterns - Deal with the composition of classes and objects.
2. Behavioral Patterns - Focus on interactions between objects and the delegation of responsibilities.

In this repository, each design pattern is explored with:

* Sample code implementations in either Java or Kotlin (if applicable or interesting, in both languages).
* Use-case examples to demonstrate practical applications.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
The project is organized as follows:
```

â”œâ”€â”€ creational/
